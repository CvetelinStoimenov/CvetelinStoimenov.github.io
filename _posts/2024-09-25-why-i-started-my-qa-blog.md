Welcome to my blog! I’m excited to share my journey and experiences as I transition into my new career path as a Quality Assurance (QA) engineer. After years of working in sales and management, I decided to pursue a passion that’s always been close to my heart—technology. 

I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, and I thrive on learning and adapting to new challenges. Throughout my career, I found myself constantly exploring new technologies, whether it was for improving workflows, automating tasks, or just satisfying my curiosity.

In 2023, I made the leap and enrolled in a QA program, where I discovered my love for ensuring the quality and functionality of software. This blog is a reflection of that journey—a place where I’ll share my portfolio, insights, and projects as I grow as a QA engineer. I also hope to connect with others who share a similar interest in technology and continuous learning.

My goal is to show the intersection of my skills in problem-solving, testing, and my passion for new tech. I look forward to sharing both technical knowledge and personal stories with you as I navigate my way through this exciting industry.

Stay tuned for more posts where I’ll dive into specific projects, techniques, and tools I’ve learned along the way.
