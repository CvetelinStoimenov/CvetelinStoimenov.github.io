# Comprehensive Testing with Playwright and QUnit

In today's fast-paced software development environment, robust testing is crucial to ensure that applications function correctly and meet user expectations. This article will explore two powerful testing frameworks, **Playwright** for end-to-end UI testing and **QUnit** for API testing, that can significantly enhance the quality of your applications.

## Introduction

With the rise of web applications, the need for reliable testing frameworks has become paramount. In this blog post, we will look at how to use **Playwright** for automating UI interactions and **QUnit** for validating backend API functionalities. These tools not only streamline the testing process but also ensure that applications are both user-friendly and technically sound.

---

## Project Overview

This project encompasses two main areas of testing:
- **QUnit API Testing**: Validates critical backend API functionalities such as user registration, login, and album management.
- **Playwright UI Testing**: Automates the front-end interactions to verify user workflows and ensure the application behaves as expected.

By integrating these testing strategies, we can achieve comprehensive coverage of our application, ensuring both backend and frontend components work seamlessly together.

## Technologies Used

The testing suite utilizes the following technologies:
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript
- **Testing Frameworks**: 
  - **QUnit** for API Testing
  - **Playwright** for UI Testing
- **Tools**: 
  - Postman for API testing
  - Docker for containerized environments
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: GitHub Actions for automated testing workflows

## Testing Code

### QUnit API Testing

Hereâ€™s a sample of how QUnit is used to validate API functionalities:

```javascript
const Url = 'http://localhost:3030/';
let user = { email: '', password: '123456' };
let token = "";
let userId = "";

// User Functionality Tests
QUnit.module("User Functionality", () => {
    QUnit.test("Registration", async (assert) => {
        let path = 'users/register';
        user.email = `user_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)}@test.com`;
        
        let response = await fetch(Url + path, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(user)
        });
        
        assert.ok(response.ok, "User registration successful");
        let json = await response.json();
        token = json['accessToken'];
        userId = json['_id'];
    });

    QUnit.test("Login", async (assert) => {
        let path = 'users/login';
        
        let response = await fetch(Url + path, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(user)
        });
        
        assert.ok(response.ok, "User login successful");
        let json = await response.json();
        assert.equal(json['email'], user.email, "Email matches registered user");
    });
});
```
### Playwright UI Testing

Playwright is employed to automate UI interactions and verify workflows. Here's a snippet of the Playwright testing code:

```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('Add New Album', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/');
    await page.click('#addAlbumButton');
    
    await page.fill('#name', 'New Album');
    await page.fill('#artist', 'Artist Name');
    await page.fill('#price', '9.99');
    await page.click('#submitButton');

    const albumName = await page.textContent('.album-name');
    expect(albumName).toBe('New Album');
});

test('User Login', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/login');
    
    await page.fill('#email', 'testuser@example.com');
    await page.fill('#password', '123456');
    await page.click('#loginButton');

    const loggedInUser = await page.textContent('#userEmail');
    expect(loggedInUser).toBe('testuser@example.com');
});
```

## Setup Instructions

To set up the testing environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
``` 
    
2.  **Install Dependencies**
    
   ```bash
  npm install
  ``` 
    
3.  **Run QUnit API Tests**
    
    -   Ensure your server is running:
    
   ```bash
 npm run test-api
 ``` 
    
4.  **Run Playwright UI Tests**
    
    -   Install required browsers:
    
```bash
npx playwright install
``` 
    
   -   Execute tests:
    
```bash
npx playwright test
``` 
    

----------

## Conclusion

Incorporating both Playwright and QUnit into your testing strategy allows for a robust examination of your application's backend and frontend. By automating tests, you can significantly reduce manual testing efforts, catch bugs early, and ultimately deliver a higher-quality product to your users.
