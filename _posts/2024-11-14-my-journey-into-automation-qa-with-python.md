Hello, everyone! I’m excited to share that I’ve embarked on a new learning journey: starting a course in **Automation QA with Python**. After completing the full **QA** path with **C#** at **SoftUni**, I decided to dive into **Python** to broaden my skill set. Although I had no prior experience with **Python**, I’m enjoying every step of this learning process and looking forward to applying it in real-world projects.

### Why Python?

Python is widely known for its simplicity and versatility, making it an ideal language for automation tasks. I’m particularly excited about using it for **QA automation**, as it allows for rapid development and easy integration with various testing frameworks and tools. 

### What I’ve Learned So Far

In the course, I’ve started from the basics of **Python**, gradually building up to more complex concepts like writing unit tests, integrating with web testing tools, and automating workflows. 

One of the most exciting things I’ve done so far is my **first Python project**: an object model of an organization with various employee types and a system for calculating salaries. This project, which I’ll discuss in more detail in my next article, has helped me solidify my understanding of **object-oriented programming in Python** and exposed me to new concepts like **serialization** and **deserialization**.

### Looking Ahead

I can’t wait to continue building more automation projects and expanding my **Python** knowledge. In the next article, I’ll give you a closer look at my **first Python project**, including the challenges I faced and how I overcame them. 

Stay tuned for more insights, tips, and lessons learned along the way!

Thank you for following along on this journey. I hope to inspire fellow aspiring **QA engineers** and **Python enthusiasts** to embrace new technologies and continue learning.
